 - Define a structure type for `top' and `bot' w/ pretty printing
 - Define a way to mark bind-times as potentially non-terminating
 - Add contract checking to lifted procedures
 - Handle bind-times which are marked as potentially non-terminating
 - Make the the bind-time lattice extensible
 - Make defining primitive operations more user-friendly
 - Cache static? into the bind-time representation for efficiency purposes
